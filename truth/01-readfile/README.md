- The **fs.readFile()** function is a part of the **Node.js** **'fs' module**, which provides methods for *interacting with the file system*. 
- It is used to read the contents of a file **asynchronously**.
- **'contents.txt'**: This is the first argument and represents the path of the file to be read.
- **'utf-8'**: This is the second argument and specifies the encoding of the file. In this case, it is 'utf-8'
- **fileIsRead**: This is the third argument and represents the callback function that will be executed once the file reading operation is complete.
-In JavaScript, a **callback function** is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when a specific event or operation is complete. In this case, the fileIsRead function will be called with any error ('err') and the content of the file ('content') as its arguments.

When the **fs.readFile()** function is called, it initiates the **asynchronous file reading operation**. This means that the code execution will **not be blocked**, and other code statements following this line will continue to execute immediately. Once the file reading operation is complete, the provided callback function, **fileIsRead** will be invoked.

The callback function (fileIsRead) will be called with two arguments:
- **err**: This argument represents any error that occurred during the file reading operation. If there were no errors, it will be null or undefined.
- **content**: This argument represents the contents of the file that was read. It will contain the data read from the file, typically as a string. The actual content will depend on the file being read.
- Inside the fileIsRead callback function, you can write code to handle the file content or any potential errors that occurred during the file reading process. 
- In the provided code example, the sum(content) function is called, assuming that the file contains a single number on each line.
